    "# Fragility\n",
    "\n",
    "Fragile: a non-obvious, distant dependency in software.  Eg: relying on the order of columns returned by a `SELECT *`.  The order is determined by the database schema, which is to say it's not defined anywhere close to the code.  The order of columns will not change dynamically in the way that rows can be returned in differing orders on every query.  Still, if the schema ever gets updated and the column order changes (which might seem like an innocuous change to the person modifying the schema) code will correspondingly need to be changed.  That can be overlooked, or even if remembered, it can be very hard to find all places in the code that need to be changed."

Think back to goodreads.com example: a user requests to view the reviews for a book.  The book ID is not known in advance (i.e., when the software was written), it is supplied as part of the request.  Ergo, the website software has a template query in hand: `SELECT * FROM book_reviews WHERE book_id = ? ORDER BY ... LIMIT 10`.
